-- Question 1
-- Write a function called `repeat'` that takes a value and creates an infinite list with
-- the value provided as every element of the list.
--
-- >>> repeat 17
--[17,17,17,17,17,17,17,17,17...


-- Question 2
-- Using the `repeat'` function and the `take` function we defined in the lesson (comes with Haskell),
-- create a function called `replicate'` that takes a number `n` and a value `x` and creates a list
-- of length `n` with `x` as the value of every element. (`n` has to be Integer.)
--
-- >>> replicate 0 True
-- []
-- >>> replicate (-1) True
-- []
-- >>> replicate 4 True
-- [True,True,True,True]


-- Question 3
-- Write a function called `concat'` that concatenates a list of lists.
--
-- >>> concat' [[1,2],[3],[4,5,6]]
-- [1,2,3,4,5,6]


-- Question 4
-- Write a function called `zip'` that takes two lists and returns a list of
-- corresponding pairs (zips them) like this:
--
-- >>> zip' [1, 2] ['a', 'b']
-- [(1,'a'),(2,'b')]
--
-- If one input list is shorter than the other, excess elements of the longer
-- list are discarded, even if one of the lists is infinite:
--
-- >>> zip' [1] ['a', 'b']
-- [(1,'a')]
-- >>> zip' [1, 2] ['a']
-- [(1,'a')]
-- >>> zip' [] [1..]
-- []
-- >>> zip' [1..] []
-- []



-- Question 5
-- Create a function called `zipWith'` that generalises `zip'` by zipping with a
-- function given as the first argument, instead of a tupling function.
--
-- > zipWith' (,) xs ys == zip' xs ys
-- > zipWith' f [x1,x2,x3..] [y1,y2,y3..] == [f x1 y1, f x2 y2, f x3 y3..]
--
-- For example, `zipWith' (+)` is applied to two lists to produce the list of
-- corresponding sums:
--
-- >>> zipWith (+) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
-- [5,7,9]


-- Question 6
-- Write a function called `takeWhile'` that takes a precate and a list and
-- returns the list up until an element that doesn't satisfy the predicate.
--
-- >>> takeWhile (< 3) [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]
-- [1,2]
-- >>> takeWhile (< 9) [1,2,3]
-- [1,2,3]
-- >>> takeWhile (< 0) [1,2,3]
-- []


-- Question 7 (More difficult)
-- Write a function that takes in an integer n, calculates the factorial n! and
-- returns a string in the form of 1*2* ... *n = n! where n! is the actual result.


-- Question 8
-- Below you have defined some beer prices in bevogBeerPrices and your order list in
-- orderList + the deliveryCost. Write a function that takes in an order and calculates
-- the cost including delivery. Assume that the two lists have the beers in the same order.

bevogBeerPrices :: [(String, Double)]
bevogBeerPrices =
  [ ("Tak", 6.00),
    ("Kramah", 7.00),
    ("Ond", 8.50),
    ("Baja", 7.50)
  ]

orderList :: [(String, Double)]
orderList =
  [ ("Tak", 5),
    ("Kramah", 4),
    ("Ond", 7)
  ]

deliveryCost :: Double
deliveryCost = 8.50
